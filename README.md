# Network Credentials Retrieval Script

This script retrieves the network credentials of the current user without prompting for credentials. It can be useful for system administrators or security analysts who need to gather user credentials for auditing purposes or troubleshooting network-related issues.

## Prerequisites

- Windows operating system
- PowerShell (minimum version X.X)

## Usage

1. Open PowerShell on your Windows machine.
2. Navigate to the directory where the script is saved.
3. Run the script by executing the following command:
  `.\NetworkCredentialsRetrievalScript.ps1`

## Script Explanation

The script performs the following steps:

1. Attempts to retrieve the network credentials of the current user without prompting for credentials.
2. Formats and displays the retrieved username and password.

## Additional Notes

- The script uses the Get-Credential cmdlet to retrieve credentials. However, in this script, the -Credential $null parameter is used to use the current user's credentials by default.
- If the user belongs to a domain, the script formats the domain and username as "domain\username" in the output.
- The password is displayed as plaintext in the output. Please ensure that you handle the output with appropriate security measures.

## Error Handling

The script includes basic error handling. If any errors occur during execution, they will be caught and ignored. You may modify the script to implement specific error handling as per your requirements.
